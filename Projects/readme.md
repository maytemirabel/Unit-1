## Criteria A: Planning

### Problem Definition

Ms. Sato is a local trader who is interested in the emerging market of cryptocurrencies. She has started to buy and sell electronic currencies, however at the moment she is tracking all his transaction using a ledger in a spreadsheet which is starting to become burdensome and too disorganized. It is also difficult for Ms Sato to find past transactions or important statistics about the currency. Ms Sato is in need of a digital ledger that helps her track the amount of the cryptocurrency, the transactions, along with useful statistics.

Apart for this requirements, Ms Sato is open to explore a cryptocurrency selected by the developer.

## Proposed Solution

### Design statement
I will design and make a **digital ledger** for a client who **is in need of an administrative system for her cryptocurrencies: Ms. Sato**. The **ledger** will **manage all of Ms. Sato's investments and transactions as well as provide fundamental statistics about the cryptocurrency Cosmos.** The **ledger** will be constructed using the software **PyCharm** and the language **Python**, taking **3 weeks** to make. It will be evaluated according to the criteria **A and B**.

### Rationale for Proposed Solution

### Success Criteria
1. The electronic ledger is a text-based software (Runs in the Terminal).
2. The electronic ledger display the basic description of the crypotocurrency selected - Cosmos.
3. The electronic ledger allows to enter, withdraw and record transaction (including the recipient, sender, timestamp, and wallet ID of the involved stakeholders).
4. The electronic ledger is password-protected to ensure the user privacy and safety.
5. The electronic ledger categorizes transactions into either buying, selling, or transfer of Cosmos coins.
6. The ledger displays the value of the cryptocurrency in different currencies. 
7. The ledger shows the real time value of the cryptocurrency.

## Criteria B: Design

#### Figure 1: System Diagram
This visual representation of how the system functions indicates the model of the computer that is being utilized as well as its descriptions such as the amount of storage it contains and its operative system. The ledger runs on Python Version 3.9.13 which is connected to a database of csv files.
