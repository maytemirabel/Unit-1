## Criteria A: Planning

### Problem definition

Ms. Sato is a local trader who is interested in the emerging market of cryptocurrencies. She has started to buy and sell electronic currencies, however at the moment she is tracking all his transaction using a ledger in a spreadsheet which is starting to become burdensome and too disorganized. It is also difficult for Ms Sato to find past transactions or important statistics about the currency. Ms Sato is in need of a digital ledger that helps her track the amount of the cryptocurrency, the transactions, along with useful statistics. 

Apart for this requirements, Ms Sato is open to explore a cryptocurrency selected by the developer.

### Proposed Solution

Design statement:

I will design and make a **digital ledger** for a client who is **Ms. Sato**. The **ledger** will **organize and track all of Ms Sato's transactions as well as provide critical and fundamental statistics about the cryptocurrency Cosmos.** The **ledger** will be constructed using the software **Python**, taking **3 weeks** to make and will be evaluated according to the criteria **B**.

The software **Python** will be used as it one of the most accessible programming languages available since it has simplified syntax and not complicated, highlighting natural language. Due to this, Python codes can be both written and executed much faster than other programming languages.

Python is the best performance booster in the automation of software testing also. One will be amazed at how much less time and few numbers of lines are required to write codes for automation tools.

 Python can be used in nearly any kind of environment, and one will not face any kind of performance loss issue irrespective of the platform one is working.

One more best thing about versatility of python language is that it can be used in many varieties of environments such as mobile applications, desktop applications, web development, hardware programming, and many more. The versatility of python makes it more attractive to use due to its high number of applications.

### Success Criteria
1. The electronic ledger is a text-based software (Runs in the Terminal).
2. The electronic ledger display the basic description of the crypotocurrency selected - Cosmos.
3. The electronic ledger allows to enter, withdraw and record transaction (including the recipient, sender, timestamp, and wallet ID of the involved stakeholders).
4. The electronic ledger is guarded; it requires a password for access.
5. 



6. A summary of each movement can be requested. 
7. A summary of expenses over a specific period of time can be requested. 

5. The electronic ledger categorizes transactions into either buying, selling, or transfer of Cosmos coins.
6. The electronic ledger shows important statistics such as Cash Flow, Balance Trend, and Expenses Structure.
