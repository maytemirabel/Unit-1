***How many USB memories of 4Gb would be required to download the memories of an adult?***

In order to calculate such amount, a couple of statements must be clarified. 
  - Technically, humans  have an unlimited 'storage capacity' for memories. Professor Paul Reber, a Professor of Psychology at Northwestern University,
  roughly calculated that the brain can store about 2.5 Petabytes of data - 2,500,000 Gigabytes or 300 years worth of TV. 
  - The human brain consists of about one billion neurons, with each neuron forming about 1,000 connections to other neurons. Such connections amount to 
  more than a trillion bonds. Neurons combine so that each one helps with many memories at a time, exponentially increasing the brainâ€™s memory 
  storage capacity. Meaning that as one grows older, our memories grow bigger and bigger at an exponential rate. 
  - Each day the human brain is loaded  with 34 GB of information. 
  - The average age of an adult is of 38.2 years. 
  - My calculation disregards the fact that human beings are forgetful and cannot recall everything they have experienced. 

With such data, this is how I calculated how many USB memories of 4Gb would be required to download the memories of an adult. 
  Yearly memory accumulation
  34 X 365 = 12,410 
  
  Adult memory storage accumulation
  12,410 X 38.2 = 474,062
  
  474,062 / 4 = 118,515.5 
  
  118, 516 USB memories would be required to download the memories of an adult.
