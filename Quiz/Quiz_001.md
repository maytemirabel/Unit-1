In Fig.1 I solved the quiz by recognizing what the key elements of the input were. In this case, the words didn't matter. Then,
I identified what the patterns in the multiple test cases were. The first and last characters of the strings were always printed. 
For the majority of the cases, there was a number in between the printed first and last characters that I later found out was the number of 
characters excluding those first and last characters. This all led me to the conclusion that the program counted how many characters there are in a 
word and then subtract 2 in order to get to the number in between the letters printed. However, if the program didn't count more than 3 characters
during its initial count, no number would be printed as the word would get printed as it is.
